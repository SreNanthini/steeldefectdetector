## 📈 Results

| Model                 | Task                      | Metric              | Score       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| YOLOv8s               | Detection + Localization  | mAP@50              | **72.1%**   |
| ResNet50 + RF         | Classification            | Accuracy            | **97.1%**   |
| ResNet50 (Fine-tuned) | Classification (Grad-CAM) | Validation Accuracy | **~96–98%** |

---

## ❓ Why is YOLO mAP lower than RF accuracy?

This is expected because:

* **YOLOv8** performs both:

  * Object detection (bounding box localization)
  * Classification

* **Random Forest** performs only:

  * Classification (no localization)

👉 YOLO must satisfy:

* Correct class ✔️
* Correct bounding box (IoU ≥ 50%) ✔️

👉 Therefore:

* mAP is naturally lower than classification accuracy
* But YOLO is **more useful in real-world production**

## ⚙️ OEE Calculation

OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is calculated as:

OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality

Where:

* Quality = (Total Inspected − Defective) / Total Inspected

👉 OEE ≥ 85% is considered **world-class manufacturing performance**
